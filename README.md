# Method

Subjects are randomly assigned to either 4, 6, or 8 patterns. Patterns are randomly selected from the 8 possible neighbors that a square has. A pattern is a color-direction two-block pairing. For example, if the first square is red, then the following square would be red and would always appear above/left/right/below the first one.

Experiment is 8 rounds long. A round lasts 90 seconds, and subjects can complete as many trials as they can within the round.

Before the 8 rounds there is a short practice session to familiarize people with the mouse clicking interface.

After the 8 rounds are finished, we test for explicit knowledge by asking participants to complete the sequence and choose where the next square would be for each of the pairs they viewed.
